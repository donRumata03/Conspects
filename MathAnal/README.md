# Mathematical Analysis Conspect

This directory contains MathAnal **_lections&&practice conspects in thesis format_**.

Thesis format assumes only an ordered list of concepts and theormes introduced with relations between them but without detailed descriptions because the lections and the book by Vinogradov are almost the same. 
The only thing that may differ is cosmetical changes of proof ordering.

The practice conspect covers methods and tricks discussed at practice lessons.

Conspect format is latex.

To compile use script compile.py: latexmk with xelatex are used
