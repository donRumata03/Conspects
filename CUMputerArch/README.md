# Computer Architecture

This folder contains computer architecture conspects.

At the moment md + [Typora](typora.io) is used. The problem is that GitHub can’t view files of this format correctly.

So, compiling conspects to pdf with pandoc is planned. At commit script will convert all «md»s to pdf.
