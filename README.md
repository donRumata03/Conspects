## Brief technical description 

There are two major conspect formats:
- LaTeX
- Markdown

both of them are compiled to pdf.

Latex is â€” through XeLaTeX compiler (its killer features were modern font support (vs. pdfLaTeX) and relatively fast compilation compared to LuaLaTeX).
And .md files are compiled to pdf by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

But, unfortunately, these tools require: too much command line arguments and escaping characters, clearing temp files, providing temp files and many other additional procedures.
[latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html) partially solves the issues, but still leaves much to be desired.

To automate those actions there are some scripts written within the framework of this repo.
Moreover, the scripts are also capable of detecting you changes (using Git API), 
committing them with proper commit messages and splitting the changes between commits wisely.


## Requierd tools' installation

- Insure you have a working latex distribution. The mainstream options are: tex-live for Linux && MacOS and MikTex for Windows.
  Note that MikTex automatically installs all required packages at compilation while tex-live requiers them to be pre-downloaded by `tlmgr` (tex-live manager) utility.
  If you experience problems with `tlmgr`'s work, visit this page: 
- Install font pack from directory `Fonts/Kurale`
- Install latexmk (via package manager on Linux or from binaries. In the second case â€” don't forget to install perl beforeâ€¦)
- Install an IDE for efficient work with latex (I've recently switched to Visual Studio Code from Texify Idea. It's a bit less clever but offers some tasty featuresâ€¦)
- To compile Markdown to pdf from console you also need to install pandoc. There are should not be any pitfallsâ€¦
- For editing Markdown files I recommend [Typora - a truly minimal markdown editor](https://typora.io/). As well as pandoc, typora supports something called Â«enriched markdownÂ» (my own term). But it's much more convenient to edit md conspects in typora but compile through pandoc. Unfortunately, Â«enriched markdownsÂ» are a bit different, so you probably need to make sure that you files are maintaind compilableâ€¦


## Building with scripts

Now, when all the desired software is installed, it's time to get used to python scripts for common operations with conspects.

With the scripts you can:
- Compile latex source code to PDFs 

At the moment there are the following script files
