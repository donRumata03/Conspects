## Brief technical description 

There are two major conspect formats:
- LaTeX
- Markdown

both of them are compiled to pdf.

Latex is â€” through XeLaTeX compiler (its killer features were modern font support (vs. pdfLaTeX) and relatively fast compilation compared to LuaLaTeX).
And .md files are compiled to pdf by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

But, unfortunately, these tools require: too much command line arguments and escaping characters, clearing temp files, providing temp files and many other additional procedures.

To automate those actions there are some scripts written within the framework of this repo.
Moreover, the scripts are also capable of detecting you changes (using Git API), 
committing them with proper commit messages and splitting the changes between commits wisely.


## Building && contributing instruction

// TODO!

- Insure you have a working latex distribution. The mainstream options are: tex-live for Linux && MacOS and MikTex for Windows.
